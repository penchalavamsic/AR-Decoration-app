# 📱 ARDecor — Augmented Reality Decoration App  

> **Redefining Event Planning with AR-Powered Mobile Solutions**

## 📖 Overview  

**ARDecor** is a **Mobile Augmented Reality (AR) application** built using **Flutter, ARCore, and Firebase** that allows event decorators and customers to visualize event setups in real-time before finalizing any arrangements.  

With **ARDecor**, decorators can instantly project **3D models of decor items like chairs, arches, and flowers into the client’s physical environment** through a smartphone camera. The app includes detailed model information like **size, price, and description** to help clients make informed, confident decisions.
